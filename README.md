This is a short multiple choice quiz that tests your knowledge of symmetric and asymmetric encryption.

As it is built using Python, you will need to install Python to use it.

Once Python is installed, the quiz can be opened using a command line interface: `Python [directory/app.py]`.

Good luck!
